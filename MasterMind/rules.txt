Welcome to Mastermind!

This game is based on the classical board game-Mastermind.
In this game, the computer hides a numerical code from you. You have to guess the code.

You are given a limited number of turns. In each turn, you tell the computer a code that you think MIGHT be the code the computer has hidden. The computer will then tell you the following things-
1. The computer will give you a \"R\", if there is one digit which belongs to the hidden code, and its position is ALSO Correct. 
2. The computer will give you a \"W\", if there is one digit which belongs to the hidden code, but its position is WRONG.
3. The computer won't give you anything if the digit doesnt belong to the hidden code.

NOTE: The \"R\" and \"W\" aren't in the order of digits.

EXAMPLE:
If hidden code is - 12345
You propose a code - 24378
The computer will give you the result- \"RWW\"
Here \"R\" corresponds to 3 and the \"W\"s correspond to 3 and 4, however in the game, you don't know that. You will not be told the numbers which \"R\" and \"W\" correspond to.

Your proposed code is valid for checking only if:
1. No digit is repeated
2. The number of digits is equal to the number of digits in the code(You will be told this number when you select your difficulty level)
3. The digits are between 1-8

If your proposed code matches, you win!! 
If you run out of turns, you lose :(

The number of turns and number of digits can be selected while playing a new game.
